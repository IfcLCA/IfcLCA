## Overview
IfcLCA leverages **openBIM** and **Open Data Standards** to analyze the environmental impact of construction projects through IFC files using Swiss **KBOB** environmental impact data from [lcadata.ch](https://lcadata.ch).

## ‚ú® Features
- üèóÔ∏è **Project Dashboard** - manage multiple building projects and track their progress.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **IFC Processing** - upload and parse IFC files; inspect elements and materials.
- üìö **Materials Library** - centralize materials data across projects.
- üìà **LCA Charts** - visualize environmental impacts; export IFC with LCA results and get nice charts.

## üöÄ Typical Workflow
1. **Export your Model**
   - IFC version: preferably IFC4 (2x3 works too)
   - Include all *Ifc Base Quantities* (NetVolume or GrossVolume)
   - Include assembly layers (prefer `IfcMaterialLayerSet`, `IfcMaterialConstituentSet` also supported)
2. **Upload**
   - Drop your IFC file in the upload area or click to browse
   - Files are processed locally and never stored on our servers
3. **Map Materials**
   - Search the full swiss KBOB database
   - Combine your materials with environmental impact data
4. **Analyze Results**
   - View impact metrics: GWP, PEnr, UBP and material breakdown
   - Use charts to identify key contributors
   - Enter project EBF (in m¬≤) to toggle between absolute and relative emissions views (explanation below)
5. **Export IFC with LCA Results**
   - Upload your original IFC file to embed the LCA results
   - LCA data (GWP, UBP, PENRE) is added as IFC property sets for each element
   - The exported IFC can be used for further analysis, optimization, and interoperability with other BIM tools

## üõ† Tech Stack
- **IfcOpenShell WASM** for Ifc parsing
- **Next.js** & **React** for the frontend
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Clerk** for authentication
- **MongoDB** for database
- **TypeScript** throughout the codebase

## üåç Open Source
IfcLCA is and will always be Open Source. Sustainability is a team effort and requires trust and transparency. The project is released under the **AGPL-3.0** license.

## üîê Data & Privacy
- **Client-side parsing**: IFC files are parsed entirely in your browser using IfcOpenShell WASM
- **No file storage**: Your original IFC files are never uploaded or stored on our servers
- **Stored data**: Only derived metadata (elements, volumes, materials, classifications, and calculated indicators) is stored in the database
- **Upload records**: Filename and processing metadata are stored to track upload history
- **Deletion**: You can delete uploads and their derived data; orphaned materials are automatically cleaned up

## üì¶ Model Requirements
- **IFC version**: IFC4 preferred (IFC2x3 is supported)
- **Base Quantities**: export element volumes via Ifc Base Quantities (NetVolume or GrossVolume)
- **Materials**: include assembly layers when possible (supports `IfcMaterialLayerSet` and `IfcMaterialConstituentSet`)
- **Classification**: provide element classification codes for amortization lookup (see below)

## üßæ Classification Support
- **Supported systems**: currently **eBKP-H** is supported for amortization years
- **Unknown/missing classification**: falls back to a sensible default amortization period
- Classification is read from your IFC model; set or correct it in your authoring tool or use [ifcclassify.com](https://ifcclassify.com)

## üìê Emissions Calculation
IfcLCA computes three metrics using Swiss KBOB data:
- **GWP** (Global Warming Potential)
- **UBP** (Environmental Impact Points)
- **PENRE** (Primary Energy Non‚ÄëRenewable)

### Absolute emissions
- Computed per material and summed per project
- Formula (per material):

$$
\text{absolute}_{\text{metric}} = \text{volume} \times \text{density} \times \text{factor}_{\text{metric}}
$$

- Useful for total project impacts

### Relative emissions (annual, per area)
- Normalizes absolute emissions by amortization years and area
- Formula:

$$
\text{relative} = \frac{\text{absolute}}{\text{amortizationYears} \times \text{area}}
$$

- Requires a valid calculation area and classification to derive amortization years

### Units
- **Absolute**
  - GWP: `kg CO‚ÇÇ eq`
  - UBP: `UBP`
  - PENRE: `kWh oil-eq`
- **Relative** (per area and year; area unit defaults to `m¬≤`)
  - GWP: `kg CO‚ÇÇ eq/<area>¬∑a`
  - UBP: `UBP/<area>¬∑a`
  - PENRE: `kWh oil-eq/<area>¬∑a`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Roadmap
- **No built-in 3D viewer**: Currently no IFC geometry visualization
- **Classification systems**: Only eBKP-H is supported
- **Comparative analysis**: Project comparison and benchmarking features are in development
- **Aditional environmental impact data sources**: √ñkobaudat coming soon...
